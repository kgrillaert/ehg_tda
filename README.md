# Learn Topological Data Analysis for Machine Learning with Me
I'll be sharing my resources and notebooks used to learn TDA. I'm specifically interested in the use of TDA for ML models using medical data such as images and waveforms. For this project, I'm using electrohysterograph data collected from pregnant women for a study of preterm birth.
